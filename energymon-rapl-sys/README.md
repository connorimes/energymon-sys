# EnergyMon Rust Bindings

The `energymon-rapl-sys` crate provides declarations and linkage for the
`energymon-rapl-static` C library.
Following the *-sys package conventions, this crate does not define
higher-level abstractions over the native library functions.

The latest `energymon` C libraries can be found at

## Dependencies

In order to use this crate, you should have the `energymon` libraries
installed to the system where they can be found by `pkg-config`.

If the libraries are not found, the build process will try to compile them.
