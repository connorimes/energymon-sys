# EnergyMon Rust Bindings

The `energymon-osp-polling-sys` crate provides declarations and linkage for the
`energymon-osp-polling` C library.
Following the *-sys package conventions, this crate does not define
higher-level abstractions over the native library functions.

The latest `energymon` C libraries can be found at
[https://github.com/energymon/energymon](https://github.com/energymon/energymon).

## Dependencies

In order to use this crate, you should have the `energymon` libraries
installed to the system where they can be found by `pkg-config`.

If the libraries are not found, the build process will try to compile them.

Additionally, the `libhidapi-libusb` library must be installed and discoverable
by `pkg-config`.
It is available in the Universe repository for Ubuntu 14.04 and later:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libhidapi-dev
```
